# Supply-Chain-Inventory-Analytics-for-Smarter-Stock-Management


This project leverages Power BI to analyze and optimize inventory management in supply chains, providing actionable insights for efficient stock management. The dashboard tracks key metrics, such as overstock, stockout rate, inventory levels, and sales from top products. It helps identify inventory statuses across categories, days of supply per SKU, and demand variation by customer type and city, enabling proactive decision-making.

Key Features:

Overstock & Stockout Monitoring: Track SKUs by stock status to reduce surplus or avoid shortages.
Days of Supply Analysis: Assess average days of supply across products and cities.
Demand Forecasting: Utilize demand patterns and coefficient of variation to improve stocking strategies.
ABC-XYZ Analysis: Prioritize products based on revenue contribution and demand variability.
Dynamic Filtering: Filter by cities, vendors, product categories, and timeframes for detailed insights.
